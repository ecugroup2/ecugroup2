        		<p>In the summer of my junior year, I had the honor and privilege of being only one of two interns with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF in Washington DC.  For 8 weeks I learned various things about cyber security's role in a federal agency.  This was very interesting and gave me a new persepctive of how the cyber security field worked.  Fast forward to Christmas break last year and I needed to apply for another internship.  I applied to many (40+ in all) different companies, including Disney.  I went through numerous interviews, but always came up short, except for one company- Disney</p>

        		<h2><h1 style="color:gold;"><center><bold>My Start</bold></center></h2>
        		<p>As I mentioned earlier, I had many different interviews with numerous companies, including Disney.  I went back to school, finished my spring semester getting interviewed almost every other week by one company or another.  But nothing came of it, which was frustrating to say the least. They say that good things come to those who wait, and wait I did.  When summer started, I began working as a groundskeeper for my local country club, maintaining two 18 hole golf courses, which was backbreaking, grueling, and dirty work.  But hey, I was earning a paycheck, and the way I saw it, any money I earned, was more then what I had before.  So, I get home from work one day, dog tired and ready to collapse, when lo and behold, I recieve a call from Burbank California.  Me being tired as I was, I let it go to my voicemail.  But then, my mom told me to play it back, when sure enough, it was Disney calling me.  So I picked up the phone, quickly called them back, fully expecting an interview or another questionairre.  But what do you know, they offered me the internship, which just totally blew me away.  Run down the stairs, tell my family, and a party erupts.  2 weeks later, I was hitting the Interstate, driving down to Disney World to begin what would become a magical experience. </p>
				
<h3><h3 style="color:purple;"><center>Here Are Some of My Learning Objectives for my Internship</center></h3>
				<ul style="margin-top:10px;">
					<li>Explore more about how networks operate</li>
					<li>Discover how some of Disney's most favorite attractions work</li>
					<li>Work with other engineers to design new networks for future attractions</li>
					<li>Garner enough respect and likability to hopefully work full time upon graduation</li>
				</ul>
			
			<h2><h2 style="color:gold;"><center><bold>The Experience Of A Lifetime</bold></center></h2>
			<p>The weather couldnt be better as I drove into Orlando on I-4 that day.  Partly cloudy skies, temperatures in the mid-80's, traffic moving smoothly for the most part.  I found my hotel (my Disney housing program hadn't started yet), got settled in, and then did a bit of exploring around to familiarize myself with the area.  The next day, I had orientation, or as Disney calls it Traditions and then moved into my new apartment.  As it would turn out, my apartment was a mere 5 minute drive from the Magic Kingdom and a 20 minute commute to my office. Not bad right? I quickly became friends with my roommates, and we developed a bond that continues to this day.  My first day was really hectic to say the least.  I'm pretty sure I was introduced to at least 50 people that day and even more projects that they were working.  After about a week of learning the ropes, I actually got to help some of the other engineers design a new network for a new attraction in one of the parks, and later on, I would actually design a new network.  Frequently my supervisior would take me to the parks and show me behind the scenes of what happened where, which made designing and troubleshooting much easier, knowing what equipment was where.  But perhaps what was really interesting was seeing some of Disney's most famous attractions and rides from behind the scenes one minute and then seeing them normally the next.  As for me, I never got sick of the parks, in fact, I would go to work from 8-4 each day, then head back to my apartment, eat dinner, get cleaned up and then meet friends up at one of the parks.  Mind you, I did this every single day for ten straight weeks.  It never got old.  I made a ton of memories while down there, more then I'll eleborate on.  But perhaps one that will always stick out in my mind was seeing people's faces light up in amazement and excitement when they saw an attraction that you had just worked on days or weeks earlier to design and see through to completion.  It was special, especially that first time.  Working for Disney, you're part of something bigger then you could ever fathom.  I had many more experiences like that, which is why I was saddened when I had to go.  It was like I had found my new home, and I was being forced to leave.  That drive back up I-95 was painful.  Every exit I passed by I had to resist the urge to turn around because I loved what I did, I loved who I worked for, what I was doing.  Simply put, I loved making the magic of Disney happen for people.  Thats what made it so special and memorable.  Thats what I live for. </p>
