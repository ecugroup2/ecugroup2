        <p>I first got into boxing by chance. When I was in my second semester as a freshman at ECU I wanted to learn some type of fighting style. I heard about club Karate and other things, but they only would practice about two days a week. I wanted to actually learn the fighting style faster and better than it would be possible to do with only two days of practice. That is when I heard about club Boxing because they practiced for four days a week, and the location was closer to where I stayed and after about a week of boxing I was hooked! About a semester after I joined boxing I had the chance to become the president of the club because of my dedication and skills.</p>

        <p>My all time favorite things to do in boxing is to counter punch. It is not simple to do, and some people just do not have the knack for it. It is a very high level technique because of the way it needs to be executed. When getting a feel for how your opponent fights counter punching can become a very powerful weapon and even easier to use than in the begining. First what you have to do to counterpunch is defend yourself. You have to be very calm because uncontrolled anger does not help anything when you are boxing. While being calm you must time your opponents movements and basically get a feel for their rythm. Next you must force them to miss a punch either with slipping or blocking. Right after the slip or block you must return fire either while they are in mid punch or while they are recovering back to their guard. This technique can demoralize an opponent and does a lot of damage because either they will be putting their weight behind the punch or they were not expecting to get hit.</p>

        <p>There is no boxer as great as the late Muhammad Ali. Although I can make this a debate I will say that there is no boxer that has had to face the things outside of the ring that Ali had to which in turn made his fights and what he was fighting for even bigger helping his name even more. Rather you loved him for this confidence, boxing prouse, and his sense of social justice, or you hated him. The reason Ali was hated was not because of his skills, but it was because of his confidence as a African American male and the confidence that he inspired into other African Americans. As a boxer I can speak from experience that it can be terrifying to step into the ring with someone and not land a single punch while their guard is not up, and the ability to do that on the highest professional level further sets Ali away from other boxers. </p>
