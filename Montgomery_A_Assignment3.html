          The Cisco CALO co-op stands for Cisco Advanced Lab Operations. What we do during this is very intensive and directly goes hand and hand with the companies everyday procedures. To be able to do your job efficiently one thing that you must know is your surrondings. You have to know what is in the lab, and the best way to access these devices. When trying to build a lab recreate not knowing what is in the lab can be a hinderance to your success, and also cause you to not be able to recreate the lab in the first place. Things always get in the way and knowing what you have available to you will significantly increase your chances of success on the job.

        Patching Connections was a major part of the Cisco Advanced Lab Operations Co-op. In fact I would say that it was the main focus. Everyday we would had to recreate a lab setup for an engineer and this consisted of having to get the devices to connect (which in itself can have more problems than you think). Assuming that the devices are even able to connect to eachother we would have to figure out how to get the connection between them because one device could be on rack 1 in the front of the lab, and another on rack 15 midway through. To get these devices connected we would have to do something called patching where we basically connect the devices to patch panels that carry the signal throughout the lab. So we would get the connection to the SDF for row 1 and for row 15 and then go to the main SDF in the middle of the lab to finish the connection in the middle. With a huge lab this in itself can take quite the time to master.

        The last thing that you had to learn in teh Cisco CALO co-op was new hardware. Besides the ability to touch equipment that many companies would not want others to touch because of their price you had to get these devices connected first and foremost. Before the CALO co-op I never heard of a SFP which stands for Small Form-Factor Pluggable. These devices allow for a large amount of scalability and versitility within your lab. In the picture above you see someone plugging a fiber connection into a SFP that is inserted into a device. Lets say that the other device does not support fiber connections and only ethernet. If you find the correct SFP that is compatible with the device you can plug in an ethernet SFP and connect an ethernet cable between the devices in that same port which I though was really cool. Throughout the entire CALO co-op you are exposed to different types of SFP's and networking equipment daily.
