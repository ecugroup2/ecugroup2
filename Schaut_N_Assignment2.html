        		<h1>Background</h1>
        		<p>In elementary and middle schools, I was bullied heavily.  I never really fit into any of the popular groups and I never enjoyed any of the things they did.  I just couldn't fit in.  As a result, they picked on me and teased me heavily.  I would get into fights often and at least once a year, I was sent to the principle's office.  All of this bullying made me really angry and sad.  I needed something to lift me up and make me happier.  Drugs and alcohol were out of the question, so one of my counselors suggested that I go for a run... </p>

        		<h2>Middle School</h2>
        		<p>As my stress and anger grew, I reached my breaking point. I had to do something.  So I joined the cross country team and decided to try running competitively.  I was suprised to find out that I really enjoyed it.  Even though the races I ran in were only 2.5 miles, and I wasn't the best runner out there, I knew I had found my sport.  I continued to work hard at both school and running, and eventually, I was one of the best on my team by the 8th grade.</p>

			<h2>High School</h2>
			<p>In high school, I immediatly tried out and made the cross country team. I found this was a great way to relieve the stress of school as well as make lots of new friends.  Every day our team would run varying distances; soome days we would only run a few miles, other days we would run between 4 and 6 miles and othe days we would run close to 10 or 12 miles.  Our coach was an IronMan and as a result of this, he expected a lot out of us.  The work we put in made us one of the best teams out there.  All the work I put in helped make me one of the best on my team.
