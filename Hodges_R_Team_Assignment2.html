			<h1>Passion for Basketball</h1>
		<div class="PassionDescription">
			<p class=column50>Basketball I considered the hobby that I am most passionate about because of how you get to connect with people on and off the basketball court.  As a young kid I played many sports growing up in the state of North Carolina that included football, baseball, and basketball.  I was blessed with incredible athletic ability that allowed me to be successfull in all of the sports mentioned.  However, Basketball was the one sport I was extremely passionate about because of my aunt Lynn.  She introduced me to watching Michael Jordan who was a basketball player in the NBA and even took me to a lot of college basketball games.  She played a pivotal role in working with me out in the backyard practicing every day on the fundamentals of Basketball.  It was her persistence that allowed me to learn the fundamentals and as I was learning the intricate details about the game I became obssessed on trying to get better.</p>

			<h1>Rec League</h1>
		<div class="RecLeagueDescription">
			<p class="column50">When I was 5 years old I started to play rec league basketball in Washington, NC from 1st-3rd grade.  At that moment I was constantly working on my dribbling skills because our coach wanted me to be a playmaker.  My method of getting better at driblling the basketball was to driblle one constantly outside everyday for hours.  My aunt pushed me at a very young age to work diligentlyWe ended up winning the regular season and post season tournmanet trophies.</p>
