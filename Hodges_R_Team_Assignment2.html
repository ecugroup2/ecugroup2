			<h1>Passion for Basketball</h1>
		<div class="PassionDescription">
			<p class=column50>Basketball I considered the hobby that I am most passionate about because of how you get to connect with people on and off the basketball court.  As a young kid I played many sports growing up in the state of North Carolina that included football, baseball, and basketball.  I was blessed with incredible athletic ability that allowed me to be successfull in all of the sports mentioned.  However, Basketball was the one sport I was extremely passionate about because of my aunt Lynn.  She introduced me to watching Michael Jordan who was a basketball player in the NBA and even took me to a lot of college basketball games.  She played a pivotal role in working with me out in the backyard practicing every day on the fundamentals of Basketball.  It was her persistence that allowed me to learn the fundamentals and as I was learning the intricate details about the game I became obssessed on trying to get better.  My favorite basketball player was in fact Michael Jordan and he inspired me to start my journey in becoming the best basketball player I could possible be.</p>

			<p class="column50">When I was 5 years old I started to play rec league basketball in Washington, NC from 1st-3rd grade.  At that moment I was constantly working on my dribbling skills because our coach wanted me to be a playmaker.  My method of getting better at driblling the basketball was to driblle one constantly outside everyday for hours.  My aunt pushed me at a very young age to work diligentlyWe ended up winning the regular season and post season tournmanet trophies.</p>

			<h1>Washington High School Pam Pack</h1>
		<div class="HighSchoolCareerDescription">
			<p class="column50">Transitioning to high school basketball was a big deal for me because I hadn't played basketball at all in middle school.  I was in the process of moving from Nash Central High school my freshman year to Washington High School.  I didn't play basketball  my freshman year because I didn't make the team.  That fueled my motivation to come back the next year as a better all around player to prepare myself for my Sophomore season at Washington High School.  I started at shooting guard for the Washington Pam Pack that year and averaged 10.3 points per game with our JV team finishing 7-14 on the year.  My junior year I was fortunate enough to play on the Varsity team where I averaged 12.2 points per game and our team finished with a record of 8-15.  My senior year I was very focused and excited to play basketball for my last year at Washington High School because of all the hard I had put into the game.  I ended up averaging 14.6 points per game and our team finished with an 7-14 overall record. </p>

			<h1>Pitt Community College Bulldogs</h1>
		<div class="CollegeCareerDescription">
			<p class="column50">I had multiple Division 2 and 3 schools recruiting me out of high school to play basketball, but I decided to stay close by home and attend Pitt Community College.  I carried a huge chip on my shoulders going to Pitt because I have always loved the game of basketball and I was determined to be successfull.  All I did my freshman year was work out in the weight room and practice basketball because that was my most important hobby since a little kid.  My freshman year at Pitt Community College I averaged 7.3 points per game, while my team finished with an record of 22-11.  We finished 2nd in the conference for the regular season and then lost in the semi-finals in the conference tournament.  After that season I wanted to prove to myself that I could be better as a basketball player to help contribute to my team.  There were a lot of distractions while being a student athlete, but I remained focused on school and the basketball team.  My sophomore year at Pitt Community College I averaged 7.5 points per game, while my team finished with an record of 23-9.  We entered the conference tournament highly motivated, but suffered the same fate by losing in the second round.</p>
