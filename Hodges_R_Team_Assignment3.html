			<h1>ECU Classroom Technology Background</h1>
		<div class="BackgroundDescription">
			<p>East Carolina Universities Information Technology and Computing Services is currently striving to improve teaching, research, learning and productivity for faculty, students, and staff through the effective use of information technology.  The Classroom Technology team reports to the ITCS department on ECUs campus and we currently have 3 full time supervisors, along with 14 student workers.  Our leadership that governs Classroom Technology, motivates us student workers to embrace teamwork, honest and open communication, working across departmental boundaries, and empower teacher relationships.  As a student worker on the Classroom Technology team, I am responsible for conducting computer help desk support for all of ECUs main campus and supply field visits to fix any long-term problems within classrooms.  My 3 main learning objectives consist of maintaining Audio/Visual equipment, provide computer help desk support, and consulting with ECU's faculty members.</p>

			<h1>Audio/Visual Equipment</h1>
		<div class="AudioVisualDescription">
			<p>Classroom Technology designated classrooms have a plethora of available technology that teachers can use to help aid the learning process for East Carolina University students.  There is a Crestron touch panel in each room that allows teachers to control volume and source different applications from desktop or laptop computer to the Sony or Mitsubishi projectors we have installed.  We currently have Air media installed in many the rooms that allow teachers to walk into any classroom and wirelessly present Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, and Word documents, PDFs, photos, and screenshots from personal smart phones on the projectors.  This application is designed for distant education students at East Carolina University because it will allow them to view teacher’s lectures online via a stored database with any type of computing device.  Additionally, there is a document camera that allows teachers to present documents that will display via projector and microphones installed in rooms to initiate speech reinforcement in relatively larger rooms.  One of my major goals was to become familiar with these technologies so that I can do my job efficiently and effectively by assisting teachers in a timely fashion.  A major obstacle I faced early on working for the Classroom Technology team was I wasn’t familiar with the technology.  It affected my confidence level initially with answering phone calls.  To ensure I was making progress on this goal as a student worker, I would step up and take a bulk of the phone calls each day.  I adopted this mindset to get exposure to the different types of common problems.  To monitor my progression as a student worker I would time myself on how quickly I would be able to solve incoming calls from teachers at East Carolina University.  I will continue to work on becoming competent on audio/visual equipment by reading books and by staying in touch with my supervisor with any questions I may have.</p>

			<h1>Computer Help Desk Support</h1>
		<div class="ComputerHelpDeskDescription">
			<p>Classroom Technology office space is in the Brewster building within the B wing and it has 12 computer workstations and a Cisco VoIP phone.  Our primary responsibility is to answer phone calls from full time faculty that are experiencing computer technology issues.  The first step of the computer help desk support process is the teacher will identify a problem in the classroom and call our universal hotline number.  Secondly, as a student worker we will ask critical questions that will help us have a full understanding of the problem and then attempt to fix the problem remotely by providing recommended actions the teacher should take.  If we cannot fix the problem over the phone, then we will put a trouble ticket in our Team Dynamix database.  We will initiate a field visit to conduct an in-depth analysis of the problem and once we provide service we will go into Team Dynamix database and close the ticket.  A major obstacle I faced while conducting computer help desk support was my ability to ask the right questions to provide quick solutions.  I sought help from external resources on the Internet that provided me insight on the importance on tone and patience.  I monitored my progress by allowing my supervisor to check the status of the equipment after I went out onto a field visit and ensure I was inputting the information into the ticketing system correctly.</p>

			<h1>ECU Faculty Consulting</h1>
		<div class="ConsultingDescription">
			<p>A major responsibility I faced while working as a student worker on the Classroom Technology team is consulting with the faculty.  Many teachers at East Carolina University don't have much knowledge about the computing technology equipment installed in each classroom.  As a result I would find myself making appointments with teachers before they had class to ensure the technology was operating normally.  I monitored my progress by how the teachers body language was during the appointments to gauge their confidence level as it related to operating the equipment.  A major obstacle I faced while working was to have patience with the teachers who weren't technology savvy.  I sought help for this learning objective by my fellow co-workers who had previous experience consulting with people in hostile working environments.  I will continue to improve my communication skills that will help further my information technology career because in my field I will be faced with building relationships with people to solve problems.</p>
