			<h3 class="EarlyLifeTitle">Middle School: Learning the Basics</h3>
				<div class="EarlyLife">When I was only in the 5th grade I made the decision to join the band program at my middle school. This included learning a new instrument and becoming somewhat proficient at it for concerts and other performances. Without putting very much thought into it I decided that I wanted to play the Saxophone. Since that day playing saxophone has become my favorite hobby and I have participated in many different and prestigious bands .</div>

			<h3 class="PubertyTitle">HighSchool: Perfecting the Technique</h3>
				<div class="pubertyparagraph">As i got older and progressed into highschool I decided to continue playing saxophone. Here I began to learn jazz and began to participate in marching band. This is where I started to realize that I was well above average in terms of technique and overall skill at saxophone. As a freshman I was named first chair and principle Alto Saxophone. As I progressed through my 4 years of highschool the jazz band I was a part of went to numerous competitions where we usually placed near the top or even won. I was even selected to be a part of University of North Carolina at Pembroke's Jazz honor band, featuring a guest artist Kenny Holman.</div>
